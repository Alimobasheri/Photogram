This project is a sample web app created by me to demonstrate my skills. It is made of two main folders. One is for the server which is entirely written with Express.js.
The other is the client, which uses Next.js, React.js and Material-UI technologies.

Currently SignUp and SignIn work.

TODO:
- Create-Post page file upload.
- Home feed page which should work by adding follow API.
- User profile and like APIs.
