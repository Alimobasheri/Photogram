# Photogram
An instagram clone. Uses Express.js, Next.js, React.js, React Material-UI.
Online deployment link: https://photogram-client.vercel.app/
Note: The server-side hasn't been deployed online yet. So the client deployment on Vercel isn't fully functional.

In progress...
This project is a sample web app created by me to demonstrate my skills. It is made of two main folders. One is for the server which is entirely written with Express.js.
The other is the client, which uses Next.js, React.js and Material-UI technologies.

Currently SignUp and SignIn work.

## To Do
- Create-Post page file upload.
- Home feed page which should work by adding follow API.
- User profile and like APIs.

## How to run
- Install Node.js
- Clone the repository.
- In server directory type command: ```$ npm i```
- In client directory type command: ```$ npm i```
- Start the server by typing command: ```$ npm run dev``` -> in the server directory
- Start the application frontend by typing command: ```$ npm run dev``` -> in the client directory
- Open your browser and redirect to: http://localhost:3000
- You can also work with server apis by sending requests to: http://localhost:5000
In the future I will add an API documentation.
